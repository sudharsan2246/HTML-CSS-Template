            While we can't predict the future, we can 
            inspire it. So what will our cars look like 
            and how will they function? Will we drive 
            them or will they drive us? That seems to 
            be the question on everyone's mind. Well, 
            we have an idea. Cars are for people who 
            want to go to more places safely and efficiently

                who use them. Therefore, Concept-i was built from
                the inside out, with a focus on making it immersive,
                energetic and, most importantly—approachable.

            Its minimal yet artful interior is designed to help 
            support its user experience. Lines flow from the center 
            of the dashboard throughout the vehicle, while Yui
            travels around them, using light, sound and even 
            touch to communicate critical information. It utilizes 
            a single wide-screen, 3-D, full-color Head-Up Display 
            that blends into an interior that is clean and uncluttered.

            advanced automated driving technologies, 
            people with all levels of ability can enjoy 
            the ride. You're still in charge of the car. 
            However, through biometric sensors throughout 
            the car, Concept-i can detect what you're feeling. 
            That information then gets analyzed by the car's AI. 
            That's when the automated features kick in.
