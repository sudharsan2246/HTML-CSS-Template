                While we can't predict the future, we can 
                inspire it. So what will our cars look like 
                and how will they function? Will we drive 
                them or will they drive us? That seems to 
                be the question on everyone's mind. Well, 
                we have an idea. Cars are for people who 
                want to go to more places safely and efficiently

                Concept-i follows our belief that vehicles 
                shouldn't start with technology—they should
                start, and end, with the experience of the people
                who use them. Therefore, Concept-i was built from
                the inside out, with a focus on making it immersive,
                energetic and, most importantly—approachable.

                At the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 
                in Las Vegas, Toyota is demo’ing it’s idea of the 
                “Future of Mobility”. As has become plainly 
                obvious over the last couple years, Toyota 
                believes plug-in vehicles will fail and that 
                fuel cell EV’s are the future. While other 
                companies are at CES showing off battery based EV’s, 
                Toyota is sticking with their fuel cells.

                Its minimal yet artful interior is designed to help 
                support its user experience. Lines flow from the center 
                of the dashboard throughout the vehicle, while Yui
                travels around them, using light, sound and even 
                touch to communicate critical information. It utilizes 
                a single wide-screen, 3-D, full-color Head-Up Display 
                that blends into an interior that is clean and uncluttered.
